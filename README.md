# Stuff

This solution/repository is a collection of hints, tips, trick, remarks and anything that 
could prove beneficial for coding c++. Whenever I encounter a topic or coding "thing" that
I need to research, even if it's tiny, I make of note of that in this. That way, my go-to
for problems is this solution rather than stackoverflow or some other resource. That does
not only help me reduce time looking it up, it is also compiled in such a way that I can
take the best of gathered information immediately. All advice does not include links
and/or sources, most of these are then written by myself or reworked someone elses code
to such an extent that they are no longer affiliated with that code. This code is not 
meant to be profited of or sold in any way. This is, again, just to keep notes.

# Target Platform / Requirements
This project is made in Windows 10 with the latest Visual studio 2017 version.
