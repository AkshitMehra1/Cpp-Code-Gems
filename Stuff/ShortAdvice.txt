1. Whether the constants are defined with enum, const, or #define
makes no difference for the performance.

2. Instead of:	a = b / 1.2345;
You should:		a = b * (1. / 1.2345);
The compiler will calculate (1./1.2345) at compile time and insert the reciprocal in the
code, so you will never spend time doing the division. Some compilers will make this for
you but only if certain options are set to relax floating point precision.

2. For-loop tip:
std::priority_queue<int> pQueue;
for (int n : {1, 8, 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 9, 7, 2})
	pQueue.push(n);
