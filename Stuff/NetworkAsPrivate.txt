Unidentified networks in Windows 10 in the 1809 version is unable to set networks as private (in their gui) if they are unidentified.

To do so:

You can't change the unidentified network to private because that is prevented by a default security setting.

    You can change the security setting so that the network is not made public in the first place.

To do this on your local server , follow these steps:

1. Start --> run --> MMC --> press enter

2. In MMC console , from menu file select Add/Remove Snap-in

3. Select Group Policy Object editor --> Press Add --> select Local computer --> press OK -->press OK

4. Open Computer configration -->Windows Settings -->Security Settings -->select Network list manager policies
on the right Side you will see options for :

double click -->Unidentified networks

  Then you can select the option to consider the Unidentified networks as private and if user can change the
location.

I hope that is will help you and is clear .
