Copy pasting from main.cpp:

	//Memory Leak Detection
	//This line will output memory leak information to output window.
	_CrtSetDbgFlag(_CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF | _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF);
	
	//Take the value in the paranthesis and insert into this line below.
	//The application will then break at the allocation of the memory 
	//leak which you can trace back through the call stack.
	//_CrtSetBreakAlloc(1072);

This is one of the more basic memory checks available in a project. There are, however,
3rd party applications which is easier to detect and solve faster. I don't know that
many of them but the best one i've tried is Memoryleak validator. You costs money but
you can go around it with temporary email and getting the trial version. It is clumpsy
and time consuming sure but you shouldn't have memory leaks in the first place so this
should be as a final check in the end that everything works. The example at the top 
should suffice in most cases.
