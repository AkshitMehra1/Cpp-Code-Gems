I am going to state this completely from my own opinion and with no basis in anything.

Whenever you have a program, there is plenty of dlls, library links, assets, whatever it may be.
That is why it is extremely important to be consistent through out the entire workspace. If you
aren't there is will be doom and destruction to the point of disasterous consequences. You think
I might be exaggerating but after spending 4x8 hours on solution with these issues, I want to
tell you no.

A project should always write to his or hers own projects Release folder. That way, it is always
consistent. If you have dependencies, each project will always look at the folders of its
dependencies. It should not have outputs of ..\..\..\Release. It is not its job to take car of
its parent. A solution is built just like a program. There is always a head somewhere. That head
takes cares of its children, which might view its own children.

The final step then is for the head to package all the files into a package which is ready for
release/running. NOT everyone one elses.

If you are thinking: What about where there are several heads in a project. Well, you can create
multiple configurations, that is, more than just "Release/Debug". Go to the configuration manager
and create the head for project and have the specifics inside that head but NEVER adjust Release
/ Debug in such a way that they are the head. Actually, that is a great rule. Only let custom
configurations be the heads.
