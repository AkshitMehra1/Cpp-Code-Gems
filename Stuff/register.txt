Register storage
A limited number of variables can be stored in registers instead of main memory. A register
is a small piece of memory inside the CPU used for temporary storage. Variables that are
stored in registers are accessed very fast. All optimizing compilers will automatically choose
the most often used variables in a function for register storage. The same register can be
used for multiple variables as long as their uses (live ranges) do not overlap.

The number of registers is very limited. There are approximately six integer registers
available for general purposes in 32-bit operating systems and fourteen integer registers in
64-bit systems.
Floating point variables use a different kind of registers. There are eight floating point
registers available in 32-bit operating systems and sixteen in 64-bit operating systems.
Some compilers have difficulties making floating point register variables in 32-bit mode
unless the SSE2 instruction set (or higher) is enabled.
